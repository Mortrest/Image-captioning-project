# Image Captioning Using Bert


In this project, I implemented a deep neural network to caption Flickr images. The model utilizes BERT LLM (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers Language Model) for embedding, which is a powerful language model that captures the contextual meaning of words and sentences. With the help of BERT LLM, the model is able to generate accurate and meaningful captions for the images.

Captioning images is a challenging task that requires understanding the visual content and expressing it in natural language. By leveraging the power of deep learning and BERT LLM, the model is able to analyze the visual features of the images and generate captions that accurately describe the content.

The use of BERT LLM for embedding is particularly beneficial as it allows the model to capture the semantic relationships between words and sentences. This enables the model to generate captions that not only describe the visual content accurately but also maintain the coherence and fluency of the captions.
